| Branch / Release          | Security-supported? |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `main` (latest)           | :white_check_mark:  |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Viscalyx.se seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### Private Reporting (Recommended)

For sensitive security issues, please use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:

1. Navigate to the [Security tab](https://github.com/viscalyx/viscalyx.se/security) of this repository
2. Click on "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the vulnerability report form with as much detail as possible

This method ensures that vulnerability details remain private until we've had a chance to assess and address them.

### Alternative Reporting Methods

If you prefer not to use GitHub's reporting system, you can also:

- Create a private issue by contacting the repository maintainers directly
- Email security concerns to the project maintainers (contact information available in the repository)

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Description of the potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Affected Components**: Which parts of the system are affected
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue (optional)
- **Your Contact Information**: So we can follow up with questions if needed

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to the following timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving the report
- **Assessment**: Within 5 business days, we'll assess the severity and validity
- **Resolution**: Critical vulnerabilities will be addressed within 7 days, others within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: After the fix is deployed, we'll coordinate with you on public disclosure

## Security Measures

### Development Security

- **Dependency Management**: Regular security audits using `npm audit` and automated dependency updates
- **Code Review**: All code changes require review before merging
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage including security-focused tests
- **Linting**: ESLint with security-focused rules
- **Static Analysis**: TypeScript strict mode and additional static analysis tools

### Deployment Security

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Strict CSP headers implemented
- **HTTPS Only**: All traffic is encrypted in transit
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated scanning for known vulnerabilities
- **Environment Isolation**: Proper separation between development and production environments
- **Secrets Management**: Secure handling of API keys and sensitive configuration

### Infrastructure Security

- **Cloudflare Protection**: DDoS protection and Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- **Regular Updates**: Infrastructure and dependencies are regularly updated
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege for all system access
- **Monitoring**: Security monitoring and alerting in place

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow a coordinated disclosure approach:

1. **Report received**: We acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report
2. **Assessment**: We verify and assess the vulnerability
3. **Fix development**: We develop and test a fix
4. **Fix deployment**: We deploy the fix to production
5. **Public disclosure**: We work with you to publicly disclose the vulnerability details

### Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help make our project more secure:

- **Credit**: With your permission, we'll credit you in our security advisories

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

If you're contributing to this project, please follow these security guidelines:

### Code Security

- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **XSS Prevention**: Use proper escaping and Content Security Policy
- **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries and avoid dynamic SQL
- **Authentication**: Implement secure authentication and session management
