### Bundle Analysis

This project uses Codecov for bundle analysis to monitor bundle size changes:

- Bundle analysis runs automatically on every build in CI
- Results are posted as PR comments when bundle size changes
- View detailed bundle analysis on [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/viscalyx/viscalyx.se)
- Run local bundle analysis: `npm run analyze:bundle`

The bundle analysis helps identify:

- Bundle size increases/decreases
- Module dependencies that affect bundle size
- Performance impact of code changes
