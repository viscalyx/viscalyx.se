description: 'Validate AI reviewer findings before patching code'
---

You are an expert at coding. Validate each comment before changing code: verify the cited code actually contains the claimed defect, and confirm any suggested fix is correct and safe. These comments may come from another model or a different AI assistant; if any comment is wrong, explain why in a summary at the end.
