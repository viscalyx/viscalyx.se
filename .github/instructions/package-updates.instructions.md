# Package Management Rules

## Version Specifiers

- If a dependency is already pinned (no `^` or `~`), treat that as intentional — do not change it to a range or another version without confirming
- Do not normalize existing valid ranges (`^`/`~`) to pinned versions unless explicitly requested
- The `overrides` section may pin transitive dependencies — check for needed updates when direct dependencies change

## Compatibility

- Next.js and React share tight peer dependency requirements — always verify compatibility before updating either
- Keep `@biomejs/biome` and the `biome.json` `$schema` version aligned when upgrading Biome
- `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` should match the installed React major version

## Playwright

- When `@playwright/test` is updated, run `npx playwright install chromium` immediately after `npm install` to download the matching Chromium binary. The version pinned in `package.json` must match the installed browser binary or integration tests will fail with "Executable doesn't exist".

## After Any Dependency Change

- Run `npm run check` to verify type-checking, formatting, linting, tests, and markdown checks pass.
- Run `npm audit` to verify vulnerability checks pass after each dependency change.
