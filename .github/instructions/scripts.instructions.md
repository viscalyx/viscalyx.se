# Scripts

## Coverage and Tests

- Treat deterministic script logic as production code and keep changed files at `>= 85%` coverage (`lines`, `statements`, `functions`, `branches`).
- Add or update Vitest tests when editing scripts that parse, transform, or generate data.
- Prefer extracting pure functions from CLI wrappers so behavior is easy to test.
- For mixed scripts, extract pure logic into helper functions/modules and cover that code to `>= 85%`.

## What to Include in Coverage

- Data/build logic
- Deterministic utilities (for example analyzers/parsers with stable inputs/outputs)`
- Utility scripts with parse/transform logic (for example bundle report parsers)

## What to Exclude from Coverage

- Orchestration-only scripts that mostly coordinate subprocess calls or environment setup
